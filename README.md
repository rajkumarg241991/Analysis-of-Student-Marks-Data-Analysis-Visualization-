# Analysis of Student Marks  (Data Analysis, Visualization) Using Python3 (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly and BI Tools: Tableau)

In this research, statistical analysis can be carried out for student’s mark analysis and 
visualization. Here, new system software is developed with the help of “python” and 
“Tableau” software. My approach extends beyond analysis and visualisation. I intend 
to compare the visualisation capabilities of two major “python” libraries with the 
business intelligence application “Tableau”. Cardiff University Undergraduate and 
Postgraduate students mark anonymized sample datasets downloaded from SIMS and 
given by my supervisor, who is already a member of the National Software Academy 
team. I need to create a system that can analyse student marks. The academic should 
be able to run the system on their own computer, and the system should be able to 
input data in CSV format that was exported from SIMS. I will be needed to create a 
variety of graphs from the data, including pie charts that indicate the breakdown of 
student classifications, such as 1st, 2:1, 2:2, 3rd, or Fail for UG students and 
Distinction, Merit, Pass, Fail for PG students. In this research, I used “Jupyter” 
Notebook for my analysis and visualisation using “python” language and its libraries
in “Plotly”, “Seaborn” and Data visualisation in BI tools “Tableau”.
The datasets provided are UG students' marks for one module, and it comprises a total 
of 8 CSV files, as well as three years of UG students' mark data (2018, 2019 and 2020). 
In 2018, students are done three assessments to evaluate their performance during the 
academic year. Assessment 1 is a 20% online test, Assessment 2 is a 30% daily diary, 
and Assessment 3 is a 50% reflective essay. In 2019, students are assessed three times 
to measure their achievement over the academic year. Assessment 1 is a 20% online 
test, Assessment 2 is a 30% daily diary, and Assessment 3 is a 50% reflective essay. 
Assessment 1 was 50% Daily Diary in 2020, while Assessment 2 was 50 % Reflective 
Essay.

The same data sets are used to analyse and visualise the marks of PG students once 
again. To perform data analysis and visualisation, this study used a total of 16 datasets. 
Using “python” libraries and “Tableau” software, I performed data analysis and 
visualisation for individual assessments and whole module marks (Final marks of 
Whole Module) after adding their weightage of individual assessments to perform indepth analysis to understand about students' performance in this research.
First, I used the “Pandas” Data frame, “NumPy”, “Python” language and “Plotly”
library for pre-processing and exploratory data analysis. I've followed the steps below.
1) Loading the data into the data frame. 2) Descriptive Statistics. 3) Checking the types 
of data. 4) Removing Redundant variables. 5) Renaming the columns. 6) Dropping the 
duplicate rows. 7) Removing Rows with Null Values. 8) Detecting Outliers. 9) Export 
“Pandas” Data Frame to a CSV File.

The data has been collected, organised, and completely cleaned; it is now ready for 
analysis, and I have also performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process 
of gaining a better understanding of data sets by summarising and visualising their 
primary characteristics. This stage is critical, particularly when it comes to modelling 
the data in order to use Data Analysis. Histograms, Box plots, Scatter plots, and other 
plotting options are available in EDA. Exploring the data might take a long time. We 
may ask to define the problem statement or definition on our data set using the EDA 
procedure, which is extremely crucial.

With the cleansed data, I began to visualise it using the “Plotly” library. I successfully 
plotted using some of the important visualisation techniques for students mark analysis 
that I described below. 
1) Histogram for Distribution of raw marks across Individual and final marks (Whole 
Module). 
2) Box plot for Distribution of Student Marks comparison for individual and final 
marks (Whole Module). 
3) Violin plot for Distribution of Student Marks comparison for individual and final 
marks (Whole Module). 
4) Bar plot/Count plot for Breakdown of Classifications of Students.
5) Bar plot for Overall Result for the Assessment year. 
6) Pie Charts for Breakdown of Classifications of Students.
7) Pie Charts for Distribution of various grades of Students.
8) Bar plot for the Comparison of individual & Whole module marks for the 
Assessment year.
9) Pie Chart for Comparing Overall Student Performance Across Years (UG & PG).

Second, I began using the “Seaborn” library to accomplish the same data analysis and 
visualisation. Seaborn is defined as a data visualisation library based on Matplotlib 
that provides a high-level interface for producing appealing and informative statistical 
graphs, according to the official documentation. Simply put, “Seaborn” is a Matplotlib 
extension with advanced features. I was successful in plotting all the needed plots for 
this research.

Finally, I used the “Tableau” software to create my visualisation. I did not use any 
libraries or coding to visualise the student’s marks in this case. After importing the 
data, I went directly to “Tableau” to make visualizations. I was able to create separate 
work sheets and dashboards here. “Tableau” makes creating data visualisations simple 
and quick. However, I was unable to build a violin plot in this instance. The 
possibilities in “Tableau” are quite restricted, and the cost of licences with extra 
features is rather high.

In conclusion, when it comes to data analysis, “python” does an outstanding job in all 
its glory. Any study requires data processing and cleansing. Data transformation and 
cleansing are critical components of any analytic process, and “python” shines at these 
tasks. Although “Tableau” is an excellent tool for data analysis, it is inefficient when it 
comes to conducting sophisticated and detailed operations. When it comes to data 
transformation and cleansing during analysis, "Tableau" also has a limited scope. 
“Plotly” is very convenient with “Plotly” express and “Seaborn” is also quite easy with 
many features.

Furthermore, this study will show how to prepare data for students mark analysis, do 
basic statistical analysis, generate relevant data visualisations, and forecast future 
trends in data visualisation techniques. A Students Mark Analysis Tool is designed 
using certain libraries of Python namely Numpy, Pandas, Plotly, and Seaborn and 
Tableau.
